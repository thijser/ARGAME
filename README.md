Mirrors AR Game
===============

While augmented reality research has grown into a mature field over the 
last years, the aspects of situational awareness and presence of 
augmented reality (AR) are still quite open research topics. This 
project is about designing and implementing a collaborative game to 
explore the different perception of situational awareness, presence and 
workload in a physical and an AR environment.

Game Concept
------------ 
The goal of the game is to solve a puzzle by controlling laser beams using mirrors
in such a way that a predefined target is hit. The game can be played by 
one or more local players and one or more remote players.

There are cards present for the local players that represent mirror bases. These 
must be placed on the table, which will be the locations for the mirrors. The local
players will be able to see the mirrors they place through the use of AR technology.
Each of the local players will only be given a few of the mirror bases needed to solve
the puzzle, and as such solving the puzzle requires cooperation from all local players.

The remote players can also see the placed mirrors, and can rotate them to influence 
the path of the laser beam(s). Only by cooperation between local players (who can
only move the mirror bases) and remote players (who can only rotate them) it becomes
possible to hit the target and as such solve the puzzle.

The game provides various different types of mirrors with different properties, 
allowing for more complex puzzles. One example of such a mirror is a colored mirror, 
and then require the target is hit with the right (combination of) colors. Another 
way to make puzzles more complex is requiring that the players combine beams together
to create more powerful beams. Other optical components like beam splitters can
also be introduced.
