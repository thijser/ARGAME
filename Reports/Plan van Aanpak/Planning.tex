\section{Planning}

The first two weeks represent the research phase. In this phase we will find a suitable augmented reality (AR) library for Unity and prepare an Oculus Rift for AR use with cameras. We'll also design an architecture for the game that covers the marker detection, networking and gameplay mechanics. All of this information will be described in the research report handed in on May 1st.

Main development commences after this phase and is organized in two week sprints. The table below describes the goals per sprint, which will serve as a helpful reference to stay on schedule during development.
