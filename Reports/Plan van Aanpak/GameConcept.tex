uitleg van spiegel game idee, precieze rollen van remote en local spelers, basis concept en hoe het later uitgebreid kan worden

name: Mirror puzzle (cooperative puzzle game)
short description: 
Players need to solve puzzles involving laser beams. The goal is to hit a predefined target with the laser beam, using mirrors to direct the laser beams. Laser beams can be blocked or manipulated by objects that exist purely in virtual space, which are made visible to the local players using AR technology. The local players can move blocks/cards (representing mirror bases) to manipulate the location of the mirrors, while the remote players can rotate these mirrors.
To complete the goal, the local and remote players have to work together to get the mirrors in the right locations and with the right orientation so that the laser beams hit the target(s). Various puzzles can be presented with increasing complexity.

remote goal: Rotate mirrors to have the laser beams hit the goal.
remote perspective: birds-eye view
remote gameplay abilities: Rotate mirrors

local goal: Place mirrors
local gameplay abilities: Placing mirrors to have the laser beams hit the goal
local perspective: birds-eye view

preventing "puppetmaster": Local players can only place mirrors. Remote players can only rotate them. The puzzles require the location as well as the orientation of the mirrors to be correct. As such, continued communication is required between local and remote players.
technical challenges: Rendering lasers for local in the right position.
