\chapter{Orientation} \label{cha:orientation}

  This chapter provides an overview of the orientation phase of the project.
  It shows an analysis of the project requirements, and the decisions that
  have been made during the project regarding choices of frameworks and
  libraries as well as gameplay elements.

  For a more in-depth view on the research that has been done leading to
  these decisions, please refer to the Research Report in appendix
  \ref{app:researchreport}.

  \section{Project Description} \label{sec:projectdescription}
    % TODO: Write description of the project.
    %       This can be similar to the problem formulation in the Research
    %       Report.

  \section{Final Product} \label{sec:finalproduct}
    % TODO: Write description of the final project.

  \section{Software Design Methods} \label{sec:designmethods}
    This section describes the design methods that were used during the
    project. It illustrates the methods that were used to develop and
    coordinate the project during the development phase.

    \subsection{Design Process} \label{ssec:designprocess}
      In designing and implementing the product, it is important that
      requirements can be changed quickly and without much problems. This is
      not because the requirements are likely to change from the client
      side, but because the choice of AR technology may change over the
      course of the project because of technical issues. The available Virtual
      and Augmented Reality glasses are mostly still in development, and as
      such this may affect the technical viability of each device.

      To deal with such changes, we use the Scrum methodology. The Scrum
      methodology describes a set of rules that, amongst others, makes it
      easier to deal with various changes during the development process.
      For a complete description of the rules that the Scrum methodology
      describes, please refer to the Scrum guide, available at
      \url{http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html}.

    \subsection{Organization} \label{sec:organization}
      % TODO: Write about organization of the development team.
      %       This also includes use of Git, Licensing and Trello.

    \subsection{Design Architecture} \label{ssec:designarchitecture}
      % TODO: Write about Unity
