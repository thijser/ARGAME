\chapter{Design} \label{cha:design}
	This chapter explains the design of the system. This includes: back-end
	design, model/graphical design, and main activities.

	\section{Main activities} \label{sec:mainactivities}
		There are several main activities in the system, corresponding to the two
		main user types of the system. These user types are both the physically co-
		located	players as well as the physically remote players. The activities
		are as follows:

		\subsection{User wants to start a game} \label{ssec:userstartgame}
			A user (or player) wants to start a new game. This user can be either
			a physically co-located player or a physically remote player. In
			order to start a new game, the user has to click the correct buttons
			on the start screen. Clicking the buttons can only happen on a laptop,
			but that should not be a problem considering the user needs to be near
			their laptop anyway to view the game world from an Oculus Rift or a
			META One, the two tools required to play the game with. When the game
			is started, other users, both physically co-located and physically
			remote, can join the same session to play the game together.

		\subsection{Physically remote user wants to join a started game}
				\label{ssec:remotejoingame}
			A physically remote player wants to join an active game. Before this can
			happen, a game has to be started first. As mentioned before, both physically
			co-located players and physically remote players can start a game session
			which other players can join.

	\section{Back-end design} \label{sec:backenddesign}
		The system is composed of three main parts: The Laser mechanics, the network
		functionality and the projection to 3D glasses. For this purpose, we divided
		the code over three namespaces, named \"Laser\", \"Network\" and
		\"Projection\", respectively.

		The \"Laser\" namespace is responsible for drawing the Laser beams and
		providing the interactions of laser beams with the other game objects.

		The \"Network\" namespace is responsible for synchronizing the game state
		between all connected players.

		The \"Projection\" namespace is responsible for providing the projection to
		the VR glasses. This namespace provides the functionality required to project
		the game world to the VR glasses.

	\section{Graphical design} \label{sec:graphicaldesign}
		For designing the 3D models, we used Blender. Blender is a free application
		for 3D modeling, and Unity natively support Blender models (provided Blender
		is installed on the system).

		% TODO Explain why we chose this graphics style
