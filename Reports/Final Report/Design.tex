\chapter{Design} \label{cha:design}
	This chapter explains the design of the system. This includes: back-end
	design, model/graphical design, and main activities.
	\section{Main activities} \label{sec:mainactivities}
	There are several main activities in the system, corresponding to the two
	main user types of the system. These user types are both the physically co-
	located	players as well as the physically remote players. The activities
	are as follows:
		\subsection{User wants to start a game} \label{ssec:userstartgame}
		A user (or player) wants to start a new game. This user can be either
		a physically co-located player or a physically remote player. In
		order to start a new game, the user has to click the correct buttons
		on the start screen. Clicking the buttons can only happen on a laptop,
		but that should not be a problem considering the user needs to be near
		their laptop anyway to view the game world from an Oculus Rift or a
		META One, the two tools required to play the game with. When the game
		is started, other users, both physically co-located and physically
		remote, can join the same session to play the game together.
		\subsection{Physically remote user wants to join a started game}
		A physically remote player wants to join an active game. Before
		this can happen, a game has to be started first. As mentioned
		before, both physically co-located players and physically remote
		players can start a game session which other players can join.
