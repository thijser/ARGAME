\section{Virtual Co-location} \label{sec:virtualcolocation}
Establishing virtual co-location is required to allow physically remote players
		to play the game together. As such, both the virtualization of the game world and
		the networking are considered in virtually co-locating physically remote players.
		Unity has multiplayer support, because of its master server to handle multiplayer
		games, but the server could be down at times. There are tutorials on the internet
		to create a basic multiplayer game that uses the master server to handle requests.
		These tutorials can be used to implement our own multiplayer support.
		% Allowing phsyically remote players to play the game, we need to establish
		% some idea of virtual co-location. This includes the virtualization of the
		% game world as well as the networking functionality required to establish
		% the actual connection.
