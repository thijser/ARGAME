\section{Virtual Co-location} \label{sec:virtualcolocation}
Establishing virtual co-location is required to allow physically remote players
		to play the game together. As such, both the virtualization of the game world and
		the networking are considered in virtually co-locating physically remote players.
		Unity has multi player support, because of its master server to handle multi player
		games, but the server could be down at times. There are tutorials on the internet
		to create a basic multi player game that uses the master server to handle requests.
		These tutorials can be used to implement our own multilayer support. Alternatively
		we could provide the players with the means to easily get and exchange their IP
		addresses through other means such as mail. 
		Besides the networking we have to look at how we synchronize locations, depending on
		the chosen game we have in order of ascending complexity several options:
		1 Use markers with a known locations, this only works if we have a limited size 
		and reasonably fixed playing area which we can prepare ahead of time. This most 
		likely comes in the form of a set of markers at the edge and middle of the playing 
		field. 
		2 Use mobile markers which synchronize between players automatically, for example
		cards in a card game. This only works if we can trust the play er to keep these markers
		within their screen or if it does not matter if there is no augmentation needed if they
		cannot see a marker. 
		3 Object recognition which tracks the locations of objects in the scene,
		this method only works if there are a number of reasonably stable objects 
		within the player's vision. 
		4 Combining the output of a compass, a gyroscope and trilocations. This is 
		works regardless of what is visible but requires accurate trilocation which works
		can be quite hard to do without building a heavy rig. 
		Of course a combination of several of the above methods is also possible. 

		Then there is the matter of making the players "feel" that they are in the 
		same location. One obvious method might be to put an oculus on the remote player(s) and let 
		them see through the eyes of the local player(s), however this is likely to cause nausea. 
		Of course we can do away with the oculus but that might result in relative pasivism from 
		the remote players as they feel they cannot 
		even control their own view while not being forced to watch what the other player does. 

		We can also let the remote player control one or more avatars within the game world
		and view these through either oculus or screen. This would keep the remote player
		more interested by giving more of a feeling of agency then just viewing through the eyes 
		of the other player at the cost of the feeling of connectivity. But this would require 
		mapping out a large part of the scene in the virtual world. 
		
		Lastly we can also let the remote player view the world from a birds eye perspective 
		this can either be done by mounting a camera above the scene or by rendering it in 
		the virtual world, the second case offers increased player agency resulting in 
		a better attention to the situation at the cost of having the map the scene fully 
		in the virtual world.

		% some idea of virtual co-location. This includes the virtualization of the
		% game world as well as the networking functionality required to establish
		% the actual connection.
