\chapter{Proposed Solutions} \label{cha:solution}
	% A description of the proposed solution, including gameplay elements.
	% The description is taken from the Product Plan. This section also
	% motivates why the proposed solution is a good solution.

\section{Laser mirror game}
	%TODO: Add references to Problem Analysis chapter where appropriate.
	The goal of the game is to solve a puzzle by controlling laser beams
	using mirrors in such a way that a predefined target is hit. The game
	can be played by one or more local players and one or more remote players.

	There are cards present for the local players that represent mirror
	bases. These must be placed on the table, which will be the locations
	for the mirrors. The local players will be able to see the mirrors they
	place through the use of AR technology. Each of the local players will
	only be given a few of the mirror bases needed to solve the puzzle, and
	as such solving the puzzle requires cooperation from all local players.

	The remote players can also see the placed mirrors, and can rotate them
	to influence the path of the laser beam(s). Only by cooperation between
	local players (who can only move the mirror bases) and remote players
	(who can only rotate them) it becomes possible to hit the target and as
	such solve the puzzle.

	The game provides various different types of mirrors with different
	properties, allowing for more complex puzzles. One example of such a
	mirror is a colored mirror, and then require the target is hit with the
	right (combination of) colors. Another way to make puzzles more complex
	is requiring that the players combine beams together to create more
	powerful beams. Other optical components like beam splitters can also be introduced.

	The game is designed to stimulate cooperation between the physically
	co-located players and the physically remote player(s). It does so by
	dividing abilities required for solving the puzzles amongst all players
	as follows:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Physically co-located players each get only a part of the
		      mirror bases required to solve the puzzle, requiring input
		      from all of these players.
		\item If there are multiple virtually co-located players, each of
		      these players can only rotate a subset of the mirrors, and
		      as such input from all virtually co-located players is
		      required for solving the puzzle.
		\item Virtually co-located players have the ability to rotate
		      mirrors while the physically co-located players do not have
		      this ability, requiring input from both physically as well
		      as virtually co-located players.
	\end{itemize}

	Because of this division of abilities, there is an interdependence
	between all players (see section \ref{sec:interdependence}), regardless of
	whether these players are physically co-located or not. This replicates the
	interdependence that exists in the crime scene example as given in the
	problem formulation (see chapter \ref{cha:problem}).

\section{Platformer}
	The game starts with the avatar of the remote player appearing
	on the table and a goal appearing above the table. The local
  players have a pile of blocks, each of these blocks exists both
  in the virtual and real world.

	Inside the virtual world a number of pre-existing structures and
	obstacles exist making it harder for the remote player to move around.
	The local and remote player must work together in order to get the
	virtual avatar to the goal.

	Team work is heavily encouraged due to this form of ability
	asymmetry and shared goal. Ability asymmetry is caused by the remote
	player not being able to place any blocks.

\section{FPS Survival game}
	Similar to the platformer, the remote players are represented
	as avatars controlled from the first person perspective and
	the local player can place blocks. What is different however
	is that the goal of the game is no longer to reach a given
	location but to work together in order to protect a given
	structure from hostile entities. Doing so requires the
	cooperation of the remote players who can most easily damage
	the hostile entities and the local players who can hinder the
	movement. Monsters continue to grow stronger until they eventually
	overwhelm the players.
	The difference between the abilities of a remote player and
	a local player give rise to an ability asymmetry and the fact
	that the monsters keep getting stronger means that eventually
	there will also be a difficulty overload forcing extra
	team work.

\section{Tower defense}
	The local players start off with a number of towers each
	which have certain strengths and abilities. They must place
	these towers on a table in front of them. What they cannot
	but the remote player can see is what paths a number of
	hostile entities will take in order to attack their base.
	They must therefore cooperate to place the towers on the right
	positions to be able to defeat the enemies before they escape
	by communicating the ideal locations of the
	towers and paths that the hostile entities will take.

	The problem with this idea is that it will very likely create a
	"puppet master" scenario where the remote player takes charge
	of the whole situation and the other players do net get a
	say in what is going to happen. This could be avoided by a
	number of extra abilities. This game shows heavy
	information and ability asymmetry.

\section{The chosen idea}
	The idea that is chosen is the mirror game idea. The reason for this
	decision is that it is a relatively simple idea, it can create hard
	to solve puzzles, and extra complexity can easily be added. It also
	prevents a "puppet master" scenario by giving both types of players
	about half of the abilities required for solving the game.
