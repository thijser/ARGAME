\chapter{Technical Challenges} \label{ch:technicalchallenges}
	% Includes the challenges surrounding AR and Networking.
	% Also motivates the choices made.
	This section provides an overview of the technical challenges of 
	this project. For each named challenge, an overview and comparison is 
	given of the possible solutions, with the chosen solution as conclusion.
	
	\section{Augmented Reality Hardware} \label{sec:arhardware}
	% Compares various AR hardware devices.
	
	% Hardware devices to consider:
	%   - META One (as indicated by the BEPSys project page)
	%       - Has a limited Field-of-View
	%       - Optical see-through glasses means AR works out of the box
	%   - Oculus Rift + mounted cameras
	%       - High Field-of-View
	%       - VR glasses, so need to project the real world using cameras.
	%   - <Add more as needed>
	
	\section{Marker-based tracking library} \label{sec:trackinglib}
	% Compares different (AR) tracking libraries.
	
	% Libraries to consider:
	%   - Vuforia (http://vuforia.com/)
	%       - Includes integration with Unity
	%   - Unity AR Toolkit (UART) (see https://research.cc.gatech.edu/uart/content/contents)
	%       - Seems to be a research project
	%       - Seems easy to use (comes with examples)
	%   - Metaio
	%       - Mainly oriented towards mobile phones, so may not be suitable for this project
	%   - <Add more as needed>
