\begin{abstract}
	This report describes the problem of developing a collaborative augmented
	reality game. Each of the relevant technical details are analysed, like the
	AR glasses for local players, VR solution for external players and other
	components such as networking. This information is followed by proposed
	solutions for the actual gameplay, after which the final idea is chosen
	along with support for this choice. The report concludes with an overview
	of the game and technical details and how they will tie together for the
	final product.
